'Fraction Addition and Multiplication, Blocked vs. Interleaved'

OVERVIEW
Project:          Blocked vs Interleaved Instruction
PI:               Rony Patel
Curriculum:

Area/Subject:     Math/Other
Tutor:            
Description:      This is the blocked and interleaved condition data from study 1. I have
                  cleaned the data up by removing tutor performed actions. I have also added
                  correct check convert steps to the add same and multiply problems when
                  student complete the problem without trying to convert the fraction.
                  Finally, I have renamed "Step Name" so that it refers to the field being
                  updated, not the correct next step. This is sensible because there is a
                  rough mapping of fields to skills and when students incorrectly update a
                  field it suggests a buggy version of the rule used to update that field.
